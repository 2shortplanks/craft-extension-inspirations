# Craft X Inspiration

This repository contains a number of extension created by the Craft team. All of these have been created by different individuals, hence code style and conventions might differ from each example.

The goal of these examples are to help you get started on your journey with building Craft X extensions.

We will continuously update this repository with examples as we progress with these/new extensions.
